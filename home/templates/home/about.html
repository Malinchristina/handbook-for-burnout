        <p class="text-dark">
          The reason I wanted to create this library is that I myself went through a really tough burnout. 
          The first few months were incredibly challenging; it could take me two hours just to get dressed for a walk, and 
          I often ended up just sitting on the stairs outside my house. I had to set alarms to remind myself to eat breakfast,
          lunch, and dinner. Routines played a pivotal role in the beginning, and there was not much else I had energy for.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark">
          Eventually, as my nervous system began to recover, I wanted to add something more to my days, but I had no idea what. 
          The creative part of my brain was totally shut down, so I started to google for ideas. 
          Even that felt like too much effort. This library exists so that you don't have to go through that struggle. 
          I want this to be a supportive and safe space where we can share our experiences.
        </p>

          No journey is the same, but we can all benefit from guidance from someone who truly understands where we're coming from.
